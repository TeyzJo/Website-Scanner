# Website-Scanner

Web Application Vulnerability Scanners are automated tools that scan web applications, normally from the outside, to look for security vulnerabilities such as Cross-site scripting, SQL Injection, Command Injection, Path Traversal and insecure server configuration.
The website malware scanner is a free online tool that can be used to scan any website for malicious code, hidden iframes, vulnerability exploits, infected files and other suspicious activities. After performing an in-depth investigation free website malware scanner reports external links, iFrames, referenced domains, infected files and blacklisting status.
